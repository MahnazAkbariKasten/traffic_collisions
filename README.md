# Analysis of Traffic Collision Data

These materials relate to the workshop for analyzing Seattle area traffic collision data.  

We are excited to launch a data science project analyzing Seattle traffic collision data to help prioritize road improvements and prevent future collisions. This is an opportunity to work through a project with real world data from beginning to end in a small team with experienced data scientists.  

To prepare for this project we are hosting two virtual workshops: Exploratory Data Analysis at 6 p.m. on June 24th and Time Series Analysis at 6 p.m. on July 1st. Data science knowledge is not required, but prior experience with Jupyter notebooks and Python is important.
